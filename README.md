# Document-Scanner
Detects the edges of the document and then crops the photo and then scans the document image.

This program will help you to scan a document into three different formats.
1) coloured warp format
2) gray scaled warp format
3) highlighted warp format

Give the path of the image which need to be scanned.
For example:
path = "Images/document.jpg"

Create a folder named "Scanned", to save the scanned copies later.

Now run the above program, which will open few windows of the different formats of the document image and a track bar.

**Important: Adjust the thresholds in the trackbar window until you obtain desired scan of the document.

Once you tuned the thresholds in the trackbars, press 's', to save the all three formats of the scanned document in "Scanned" folder.
